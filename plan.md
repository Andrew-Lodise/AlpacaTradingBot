    the market's open, high, low, and close prices for the day

## I want the program to be able to 
1. graph the 5 year, 1 year, and 3 month graphs for the stock
2. for each graph determine the following
    - general direction of the graph
    - other things to add later

## use the data to figure out if its a good investment or not
